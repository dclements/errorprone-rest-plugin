# Error Prone REST Plugin

This is a plugin for [errorprone](https://errorprone.info/) for checking REST APIs and common issues with API systems, as well as to allow the engineers to play around with certain concepts that are beneficial in that space. 

Plans for this plugin include:

* JAX-RS patterns
* AIP patterns
* Taint checking and related patterns
* Various security patterns, especially relating to the [OWASP API Security Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/).
